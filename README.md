# Email-Spoof-Checker
This script analyzes email headers to detect potential spoofing attempts by extracting key information such as the senderâ€™s domain and IP address. It performs SPF (Sender Policy Framework) validation to ensure the sender's domain is authenticated, printing warnings if the SPF record is missing or invalid.
